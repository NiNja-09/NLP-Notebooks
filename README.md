# NLP-Notebooks

This repository contains notebooks showcasing various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks implemented using Python and popular NLP libraries such as NLTK, SpaCy, and scikit-learn. The notebooks cover a wide range of NLP tasks including tokenization, normalization (stemming and lemmatization), bags of words, named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, different encoding techniques, word embedding using Word2Vec and GloVe, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

## Notebooks

- [Tokenization](Tokenization.ipynb): Notebook demonstrating tokenization techniques using NLTK and SpaCy.
- [Stemming](Stemming.ipynb): Implement stemming techniques with NLTK and SpaCy in Python using 'NLP - Stemming' notebook.
- [Lemmatization](Lemmatization.ipynb): Explore lemmatization methods in Python using NLTK and SpaCy within the 'NLP - Lemmatization' notebook.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab
- NLTK
- SpaCy
